# GSA/CoE-MPP [Issue 1](https://github.com/GSA/CoE-MPP/issues/1)

## Background

The Innovation Showcase is a website that will include multiple prototypes for public viewing. The intention is to start the Showcase on [the Federalist platform](https://federalistapp.18f.gov/), where built-in tools and templates are available and can be modified. 

### The project

The objectives of the Showcase are:

* Put one prototype on the Federalist platform.

### The user story

As a user, I need to be able to access a URL that will display a prototype that is located on Federalist. 

## Our expectations

Ready to view live website that is hosted on the Federalist platform.
 
### Deliverables

This is a list of deliverables that the government is expecting to obtain as a result of this CoE MPP buy:

* Codebase in HTML/Markdown on GitHub.
* Live site on Federalist.

### Definition of Done / Acceptance Criteria

This will be considered done when the websiteâ€™s source code is saved on GitHub and when the prototype is live on Federalist.

### Time estimate

The government needs this user story to be completed within two weeks from the start of the associated sprint. The estimated time of delivery if work begins Monday (and accounts for holidays), October 7, 2019 is Tuesday October 22, 2019.
